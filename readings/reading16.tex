We've reached the end of this course.

First off, I want to thank you -- this has been a wonderful journey,
and I hope you've enjoyed all the mathematics that we've gotten to see
on the way.

The plan for the last couple lectures are ``problem sessions'' where
we can discuss some of the remaining problem sets.  And some students
have expressed an interest in giving a talk (which is one of the
multiple forms of assessment in this course).
