\maketitle

As we work through Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes},
it feels like we frequently run into Thom spaces, the Thom isomorphism
theorem, \ldots so let's finally work through some of this more
explicitly.

One reference is the chapter in \textit{Characteristic Classes} on
Thom spaces and tranversality.  But I think it is also workwhile to
direct your attention to Milnor's \textit{Topological from a
  Differential Viewpoint}, which you may have looked at before (say,
in a differential topology course).  That text does a nice job of
discussing the story of framed cobordism and the Pontrjagin--Thom
construction.

By the end of this week then, we'll see the result that ``lies at the
heart of Thom's theory,'' namely the relationship between the homotopy
group of universal-argument Thom space and the oriented cobordism
group.  This opens up a wonderful relationship between the geometry of
manifolds (i.e., cobordism) and algebraic topology (i.e., certain
homotopy groups).
