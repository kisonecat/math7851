\begin{document}
\maketitle

So far, the only ``characteristic classes'' we have explored are
Stiefel-Whitney classes.  But there are more!  This week, open up
Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes} and read ``Complex
Vector Spaces and Complex Manifolds'' where you'll meet \textbf{Chern
  classes}, characteristic classes associated with \textit{complex}
vector bundles.

Goals this week include stability (that
$c(E \oplus \mathbb{C}) = c(E)$), naturality, a product formula, and
some sample calculations.  For example, we will want to compute
$c(T\mathbb{C}P^n)$.  Much of this is in the following chapter (which
is literally called ``Chern classes'') and will wait until next week.

Chern classes prepare us for Pontrjagin classes, characteristic
classes of real vector bundles which are defined by taking the (even!)
Chern classes of the complexification of a real bundle.
