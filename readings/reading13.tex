\maketitle

Just as we spent more than a week with Chern classes, we have more than a week to spend with Pontrjagin classes.

After reading the ``Pontrjagin classes'' chapter from
Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes} last week, continue
reading from the \textit{Characteristic Classes} textbook, working
through the sections on Chern numbers, Pontrjagin numbers, partitions,
etc., until we reach the discussion of the oriented cobordism ring.

A goal this week is to explore the cobordism ring via
\textbf{Pontrjagin numbers}; and being ``just'' numbers, perhaps these
will feel a bit more accessible than the cohomological invariants
we've been studying so far. The Euler characteristic is certainly
easier to discuss than the Euler class!
