From Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes}, read
Chapter~9, ``Oriented bundles and the Euler class.''  This provides a
segue connecting our $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ study to integral
classes by studying a particular cohomology class with integer
coefficients, i.e., the Euler class.  For an \textit{oriented}
rank-$n$ bundle $E$ over $B$, we already have the $n$-th
Stiefel-Whitney class $w_n \in H^n(B;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$, and you
can think of the Euler class as a refinement of this to a class
$e \in H^n(B;\mathbb{Z})$.  This results in some exciting new
features: the Stiefel-Whitney classes are stable, meaning that
$w_i(E) = w_i(E \oplus \mathbb{R})$ where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes a
trivial line bundle; the Euler class is \textit{unstable}, and indeed
the Euler class of a bundle with a trivial summand vanishes!  Far from
ruining the Euler class, this is truly a feature, because it means
that the Euler class can view unstable phenomena.  For example, the
Euler class can detect the nontriviality of the tangent bundle $TS^2$
even though that bundle is stably trivial.

There are some other references which I think you will find helpful
for this week.  The first is Hatcher's \textit{Vector bundles and
  K-theory}.  From this, read Chapter~3.2 on the Euler class.  I also
want to draw your attention to Bott and Tu's \textit{Differential
  Forms in Algebra Topology} which I think you will find very
inspiring.
