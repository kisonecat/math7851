\begin{document}
\maketitle

There is a lot more to do with regards to Chern classes.  As we
continue to read Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes},
our next chaper would be ``Chern classes'' and there is a lot there.

Much of this continues from last week, and includes results on
stability, naturality, various formulas, and ultimately a computation
of the total Chern class for complex projective space.
