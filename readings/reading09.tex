\begin{document}
\maketitle

Our goal this week is to pay back an IOU: when we defined the
Stiefel-Whitney classes, we did so using the Steenrod squares.  I
direct you towards Hatcher's \textit{Algebraic Topology} in Section
\textsection 4.L, which introduces Steenrod squares.  We'll survey the
construction of the Steenrod squares, and we'll use them to
investigate manifolds with cohomology ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/x^3$.

For the remainder of the week, focus on Milnor--Stasheff's
\textit{Characteristic Classes} android read the content entitled
``Computations in a Smooth Manifold.''  The highlight here is the
so-called \textbf{Wu formula}, named for Wu Wenjun.  The Wu formula
relates Steenrod squares and Stiefel-Whitney classes via the so-called
``Wu class,'' and there are some striking consequences, e.g., we'll
investigate the Stiefel-Whitney classes of orientable 3-manifolds.
