\maketitle

From Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes}, read the
chapter on multiplicative sequences and the signature theorem.  Here
we'll meet Hirzebruch's celebrated ``signature theorem'' which
expresses the signature of a manifold in terms of the Pontrjagin
numbers.  For more on this, I very highly recommend Hirzebruch's book
\textit{Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry}.

At the end of this week, we'll survey Milnor's original \textit{exotic
  spheres} paper, and see how the machinery we've developed in this
course can identify a smooth manifold which is homeomorphic but not
diffeomorphic to $S^7$.
