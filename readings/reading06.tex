\maketitle

From Milnor--Stasheff's \textit{Characteristic Classes}, read
Chapters~7 and 8.

Armed with this cell structure, we'll first compute the cohomology of
the Grassmannian.  It is striking how straightforward this is, given
the apparent complexity of the cell structure.

The \textit{reason} we wanted to compute the cohomology was to gain
some insight into characteristic classes, and specifically the
Stiefel-Whitney classes.  Way back at the beginning of the course, we
were presented with some axioms for the Stiefel-Whitney classes.  Now
we can provide existence and uniqueness proofs for classes satisfyinig
those axioms.
